User Stories- 
	I want to create a memory game where you have 12 cards and when you click on the a card a image will appear and you will need to match the images to remove the cards from the screen. The game will record how many clicks it will take for you to clear the screen. You are able to reset the game at any time! :)

What is unfinished and would like to do more-
	Game is working, however, would like to have made the cards be more animated. Maybe made the game more animated all together.
